Goal: The main_pybank.py program takes a .csv file in the Resources folder (one directory up from this README) and summarizes the data.
	The data summary appears in the terminal and is also printed in the file analysis.txt in the Analysis folder.

Requirements: To successfuly run man_pybank.py, a .csv file with two columns (first is date, second is profit/loss dollar
	values) and one header.  

Directions: Run main_pybank.py in the terminal. You will be prompted to give the filename without the extension (i.e.,
	budget_data not budget_data.exe). The analysis will print in the terminal and a text file named analysis.txt with the same data will
	be created in the Analysis folder. If the file already exists you will be prompted to delete it and run the program again.
